        <h2>Contemporary Scene</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Contemporary roller derby began its revival in Austin, Texas, in the early 2000s as an amateur, all-female, self-organized sport with a do-it-yourself ethos. It rapidly expanded internationally, with leagues forming in over 2,000 locations worldwide, spanning North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. Many leagues emphasize a punk aesthetic and third-wave feminist values, and most compete on flat tracks, though some banked tracks exist. Local bouts attract diverse fans, with some leagues drawing crowds of up to 7,000. Some successful teams compete regionally and internationally.

        <p>Roller derby culture includes "derby names," where players adopt pseudonyms featuring wordplay or pop culture references. This tradition has sparked legal discussions around intellectual property. Although injuries are common, leagues prioritize safety with medical personnel on-site, and insurance options are available through the WFTDA. The sport has expanded to include male and all-gender teams, college leagues, and junior programs.

        Modern media coverage has increased roller derby's visibility, with leagues promoting bouts online and through streaming platforms like WFTDA.tv. The community-driven nature of the sport is supported by media like FiveOnFive magazine, which covers topics from training to nutrition.
