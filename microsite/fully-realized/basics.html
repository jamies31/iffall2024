                <p>Roller derby is played in two 30-minute periods, divided into short rounds called "jams," each lasting up to two minutes. Each team can have up to 15 players but fields only five at a time—one "jammer" and four "blockers." Blockers form a "pack" and aim to prevent the opposing jammer from advancing while assisting their own jammer to pass through the pack.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Jammer: Wears a star on their helmet and scores points by passing opposing blockers.</li>
                <li>Blocker: Works to block the opposing jammer and helps their jammer advance.</li>
                <li>Pivot: A designated blocker with a stripe on their helmet who can become a jammer if the jammer passes the star to them</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
        At the start of each jam, blockers line up between the "jammer line" and "pivot line," while jammers begin behind the jammer line. The first jammer to legally pass the pack earns "lead jammer" status and can end the jam early by tapping their hips. Jammers score one point for each opponent they lap after their initial pass through the pack.

        Blocking and Penalties
        Blockers use legal contact to impede opponents but cannot block with certain body parts or hit opponents in restricted areas like the back or below the thighs. Rule violations result in penalties, sending the offending player to the penalty box for 30 seconds.

        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <div class="positions">
        <ul>
            <li>Ending the Jam: Lead jammers can end a jam early to prevent the other team from scoring.</li>
            <li>Passing the Star: The jammer can transfer their role to the pivot by handing over the star helmet cover.
            </li>
            <li>Forming Walls: Blockers can work together to create walls to stop the opposing jammer.
            </li>
            <li>Goating: Blockers trap an opposing blocker to slow the pack, creating opportunities for their jammer</li>
        </ul>
