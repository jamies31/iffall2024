        <p>
            Take me out tonight<br>
            Where there's music and there's people<br>
            And they're young and alive<br>
            Driving in your car<br>
            I never, never want to go home<br>
            Because I haven't got one anymore<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Take me out tonight<br>
            Because I want to see people<br>
            And I want to see life<br>
            Driving in your car<br>
            Oh, please, don't drop me home<br>
            Because it's not my home, it's their home<br>
            And I'm welcome no more<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if a double-decker bus crashes into us<br>
            To die by your side<br>
            Is such a heavenly way to die<br>
            And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us<br>
            To die by your side<br>
            Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Take me out tonight<br>
            Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care<br>
            And in the darkened underpass<br>
            I thought, oh God, my chance has come at last<br>
            But then a strange fear gripped me<br>
            And I just couldn't ask<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Take me out tonight<br>
            Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care<br>
            Driving in your car<br>
            I never, never want to go home<br>
            Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum<br>
            Oh, I haven't got one<br>
            Oh, oh<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            And if a double-decker bus crashes into us<br>
            To die by your side<br>
            Is such a heavenly way to die<br>
            And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us<br>
            To die by your side<br>
            Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, there is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
            There is a light and it never goes out<br>
