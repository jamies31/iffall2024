        <h1>Title: Hwachae (Korean Fruit Punch)</h1>
        <h2>Description: </h2>
        <p>Hwachae is a traditional fruit punch from Korean, dating back to 57 BC - 668 AD. Modern day hwachae is often made with strawberry milk and some kind of carbonated beverage, such as sprite or cider, and filled with chopped up fruits. It is also common for hwachae to be served inside a watermelon. Recently, hwachae has been going viral on the internet, praised for being a refreshing and hydrating treat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <p>Some common ingredients in hwachae are watermelon, milk/strawberry milk, berries, mangoes, banana, honeydew, kiwi, jelly, sprite, and ice cubes. Hwachae is easily customizable to what you have in your pantry, so most fruits and refreshing drinks will work.</p>

        <p>I liked how the different recipes and images are put in circular frames. It helps break up the sharp edges that are found all over the rest of the website, and also gives it a more fun feel. The overall color palette is more simple, with beige and white being the primary colors I see, but there are also pops of color here and there, like the pink for the cookbook banner, which helps it stand out even more.</p>

        <p>I personally really enjoyed the rustic and traditional feel of this. Small details such as the elegant logo and the pattern bordering the top of the website come together to give this site a very cohesive feel. Different sections, such as serving suggestions and recipe tips, are put in a colored box to distinguish it from the rest of the recipe, and the recipe itself is divided into sections with images which makes it more readable. </p>

        <p>I really like the banner in this website, with the hand drawn elements of chinese ingredients. Right away, it captures the attention of the viewer and informs that of the cuisines that are shown in the site. I also like how some of the ingredients in the recipes are links which take you to a page that tells you more about that particular ingredient.</p>

        <p>I really like the visual hierarchy and contrasting elements in this page. For instance, the contrast between the images of the product and the illustrated backgrounds. I also enjoyed the use of gradient and a grainy texture in the background of some of the banners. another element from the somisomi website that I might implement in my own recipe website is a colorful/playful color scheme. While yellow and purple aren't colors that are usually used together, the website blends them in such a way that it look very bright and vibrant, rather than tacky.</p>

        <p>This website does a very good job of using visual elements that match the vibe of their products: bright, natural, glowy. I like how they use all caps for some of the headers and the logos and also bold that text to distinguish it from lower level texts. I also enjoy the color palette of the website, with mainly green and white, which connotes cleanliness and nature, as they intended it to. </p>

        <p>I've always really liked the hand drawn elements that Trader Joes uses, and the overall rustic feel. While I didn't necessarily select TJs for their recipe page, I did notice how nicely organized it was. On the recipe pages, they have more of these hand drawn elements in the background, but reduced to a lower opacity so as to not distract from the main text. The top of each recipe page has a banner with the title of the recipe, tags, and description. This is a useful feature, as it gives the user an overview of the recipe before they choose to make it and proceed to read the instructions below.</p>
