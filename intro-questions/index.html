            Jamie's Intro Questions
        </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Jamie Shin, Computer Science major, Senior</li>
            <li>I am minoring in HCI! I used to be a com des second major and want to continue doing creative work and this class feels like a good intersection between my interests.</li>
            <li>I've taken multiple classes in frontend and full stack development and have also used html/css/javascript in past internships!</li>
            <li>I hope to learn more about visual hierarchy and how to create a balanced feel in a website while still having it be user friendly. I'm also curious to learn more about what makes a user experience good/bad.</li>
            <li>Designing on a screen involves thinking about how users might interact with different elements. For instance, the flow of certain functionalities, such as a user log in flow. clicking login button -> authentication page -> navbar ui changes to logged in ui -> etc </li>
            <li>I have always thought that <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> was such an intuitive app to use. It might not be the prettiest design wise, but the user experience is really good and all the functionalities are easy to use and understand. Another example would be Notion (which isn't a website, but a platform). I think that Notion's hierarchical structure with workspaces and pages is really useful and the aesthetic of the website is also clean and simple while being customizable.</li>
            <li>A website that exhibits effective communication is <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/?c=.pi0.pk36239956_25650614176&c=.pi0.pk36239956_25650614176&ghost=true&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwuMC2BhA7EiwAmJKRrL5q95YviCZsCA66mNmVlDr_3to50RaMgUME-lObGZkhr3boJKxyKRoC5HAQAvD_BwE">Airbnb</a>
                I think the airbnb website is very good at being straight to the point without having excess/distracting features. The search bar being at the top and centered highlights it as the main feature, and beneath it, there are 
                a bunch of icons for various secondary filters that users can apply.
            </li>
            <li>I think that <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a> is an example of a well working website. 
                I don't find myself looking for features that aren't already there; for example, having the recently watched section, top trending, and watch it again sections makes it easy to quickly find the 
                shows/movies I want to watch. The main thing that I really like about netflix that I haven't seen people talk about is how when you hover
                over a tv show or movie, it lets you preview a clip of it. This is super helpful and saves time when it comes to choosing something to watch.
