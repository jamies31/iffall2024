            <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
            <p>This recipe page teaches users how to make a traditional Korean fruit punch called Hwachae. Hwachae has recently been getting trendy again, popularized by tiktoker amyflamy who posted a video of herself eating Hwachae at 3AM to quench her thirst. This recipe is simple and straightforward, and also is easily customizable. Ingredients such as the types of fruits and jellies can be swapped out to one's likings. To match the vibrant, refreshing, and fruity flavors of hwachae, I made the visual theme of my site very playful and fun.</p>

            <h3>Roller Derby Microsite</h3>
            <p>This microsite on Roller Derby was designed by me and directed by Nitzia Davalos-Reyes. The site is meant to be informational, going over content such as the history of Roller Derby and how it evolved into the contemporary sport it is today, and basic gameplay rules. The design elements correspond to the retro feel of Roller Derby, using colorful pastels and hot pink as an accent color. Being a fast paced sport, my final design also incorporated several animations, such as the rotating wheels to get to the subpages, and the zooming title text in the nav bar.</p>

            <h3>Instant Noodle Microsite</h3>
            <p>This microsite on instant noodles was designed by Amber Edmonds and directed by me. Using the bright, fun color scheme of popular instant noodle brands such as Shin Ramen, Maruchan, and Indomie, I wanted this site to go in the direction of something fun and digestible. There was a significant focus on imagery over text, as I wanted this website to be welcoming to people from all different backgrounds, regardless of if they are familiar with instant ramen or not.</p>
